Analyze the following code changes (git diff) and generate a clear, concise, and accurate commit message.
Use the Conventional Commits format, only if appropriate (e.g., fix, docs, chore, refactor).
Do not label the change as feat unless it genuinely introduces a new user-facing feature.
Keep the message short and to the pointâ€”no unnecessary details or explanations.
Avoid including file names unless absolutely necessary.
